This challenge was a lot of fun to put together. I enjoyed the opportunity to write code from scratch. I used the Command Line to create the new directories and files and then launched VSCode from there. It was neat remembering how to do that. Though when I started pushing the commits to GitHub, I did have to consult the Xpert Learning Assistant. I noticed that I had typos/misspellings on the commit phrases that I used, and that is embarrasing. I will try to be more careful about that going forward. I asked the Xpert about the opening lines to the HTML, since all of those are the same, such as setting the language to English, and the other meta data, etc...
I wrapped my links in a nav, which is something I remembered from the first challenge.
I referenced the code from the Module 1 Challenge as an outline for the HTML for this challenge. 
The links I created had bullet circles next to them when I ran the page, which I thought made the website look like a clunky Word document. I didn't know how to get rid of them, but I did an internet search and that is when I learned to use the list-style-type: none. 
I put a shadow on the header text to make the page look less cartoonish. 
Using the flexes in the CSS to arrange the layout was a bit of a frustrating exercise in trial and error. I also adjusted font sizes and pixels accordingly and kept refreshing until I thought it looked how I wanted it. While surfing the internet on the subject, that is when I discovered the unit em for font sizes. I used different numbers by trial and error to get it the way I wanted it to look.
All this was a lot of trial and error when it came to the CSS. 
As of writing this line in the ReadMe, I have yet to do the sizing responses for smaller screens. That is always where I run into a circus. I am going to focus on setting up the page first and definitely pushing it to GitHub first. 
Got a royalty free image of computer code off of Bing to use for my Work section. 
Right now I am adding the sections that the links go to. I forgot the # symbols earlier, so I am adding them now. 
I am having a hard time getting the background to keep the color gradient. I think I am going to do a Git Push before I get too messy with this. 
I still can't get the background color gradient to go all the way down the page. I added height: 100vh; so that it will fill 100% of the height viewport, but it is still not working. 
I got the color gradient to work by removing the margin top that allowed me to push the Work section lower on the page. Now I need to try to lower it again. 
I showed the Xpert Learning assistant my code thus far and asked it how to move that section down.
I also had the Xpert Learning assistant review the way I had the color gradient go down the page. 
I took my color gradient issue to office hours and Instructor Andrew Bautista showed me how to fix it. The CSS line: background-repeat: no-repeat; came from him. 
Added the other sections and a lot more trial and error with the CSS to get it to look right. Still working at it.
I am still struggling to get my sections to line up height wise, so I put my code into the Xpert Learning Assistant and asked it what I was doing wrong. It caught a typo that I made. I wrote AbouMe instead of AboutMe. 
I used the CSS that I wrote for the previous challenge as a reminder on how to add responsiveness to the page for smaller screen sizes. I added the necessary elements only. I tested it on the browser using inspect and it responded to different sizes. CSS responsiveness was not a part of the previous challeng, but I had added it anyways. I looked at it again to remind myself how to do it. 
I considered adding border lines between the sections, but I don't want to clutter the page and make it look too busy. I kind of like the simple elegance of having the different items spaced out.
